### ⁉ What is happening here?
Firstly, I would like to explain why this project is called Thats Me.

Actually, this is not a game project. This is a resume. What? A resume? How come?

As a game developer, I enjoy gamifying everything I work on. That's why I thought my resume should be like a game. Whenever someone wants to look at my resume, all they have to do is play the game via the Github link without downloading anything.

👀 Yes, here is your character inside a space station 👇.

You will be able to watch videos of my game projects as you explore inside the space station. Yes, that skeleton was me.

In this scenario, my assistant robot will accompany you and narrate the games to you.
